## Suggestions

In the file structure of this project, pictures relevant to the main content of the document should be placed under `figures`, while pictures for decorative purposes should be put into `images`.

When editing different sections of the document, it is better to put each section into a separate file under the `src` directory to keep the main tex file neat and clear.
