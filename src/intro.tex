In this report, we present a simple time machine called \texttt{SIDRAT}. The time machine is a simple device that can be used to travel back in time. The time machine is powered by a flux capacitor, which generates the 1.21 gigawatts of power required to travel through time. The time machine is controlled by a simple interface that allows the user to input the desired time and date to travel to. The time machine is equipped with a safety feature that prevents the user from killing their grandparents and the creators of this machine.
